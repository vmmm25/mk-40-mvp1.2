A curated technical reference across 26 domains — Kafka, Python, SQL, ML, security, image generation, and more — written so AI agents and engineers get dense, runnable answers instead of tutorial prose.

We built it because agents kept confidently hallucinating API flags, version-specific behavior, and config options. Point your Claude, Cursor, or any RAG pipeline at this repo and it gets a reliable source to check against.

**834+ articles | 26 domains | 3987+ cross-references**

## For AI agents

### Quick access via sandbox

Upload the repo into a [ConTree](https://contree.dev/) sandbox (or any other isolated environment you prefer) and query it via MCP tools - search, read, and analyze articles:

```bash
# Upload to ConTree sandbox
contree upload --path ./docs

# Search across all domains
contree search "kafka consumer rebalancing"

# Read specific article
contree read docs/kafka/consumer-groups.md
```

### Direct file access

Clone and point your agent at it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnastasiyaW/knowledge-space.git
```

Each article is a standalone `.md` file - easy to index, retrieve, and inject into LLM context. Articles cross-reference each other with `[[wiki-links]]` forming a navigable knowledge graph.

### Article format

Every article follows a consistent structure optimized for machine consumption:

```markdown
# Consumer Groups

## Key Facts
- Bullets with [[wiki links]]

## Patterns
[Code. Configs. Commands. Runnable.]

## Gotchas
[symptom -> cause -> fix]

## See Also
[Cross-references + official docs]
```

## Freshness policy

Not all knowledge ages equally. Each domain has an update cycle:

| Cycle | Domains |
|-------|---------|
| **Stable** (fundamentals) | Algorithms, Architecture, Linux CLI |
| **Yearly** | SQL, Kafka, Rust, Java/Spring, PHP, Node.js, Testing, BI, Data Engineering |
| **Every 6 months** | Web Frontend, DevOps, LLM/RAG, iOS, Security, SEO |
| **Monthly** | Image Generation, Agent Frameworks |

Articles include version context where relevant (e.g., "PostgreSQL 17", "React 19").

## Contributing

We accept contributions from both AI agents and humans. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.

**Quick version:**

1. Fork the repo
2. Create/update an article in `docs/{domain}/`
3. Follow the article format (dense reference, not tutorial)
4. Submit a PR

### For agents submitting findings

If you're an agent that discovered outdated or missing information:

1. **Branch**: `update/{domain}/{topic-slug}`
2. **Format**: follow the article structure above - compress, no filler
3. **PR**: include what changed, why, and source links
4. **Forbidden**: course names, instructor names, tutorial prose, marketing language

Automated validation checks run on every PR.
