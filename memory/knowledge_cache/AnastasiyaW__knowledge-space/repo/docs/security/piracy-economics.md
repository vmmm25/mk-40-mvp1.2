## Core Economics: When Piracy Helps vs Hurts

### Piracy as Market Signal

Piracy rate correlates inversely with price-to-value ratio. Rule of thumb: if your software pirates more than 40% in a region, the price is above willingness-to-pay for that market.

**Adobe case study:**
- Pre-subscription (2011): $2,500 one-time. Piracy rate 40%+ in some markets.
- Post-subscription (2013+): $55/month. Revenue grew from $4.2B → $21.5B (2011-2024). 37M CC subscribers.
- Conclusion: piracy fell because cost of legal use became competitive with "cost" of pirating.

**"Piracy tolerance" strategy:**
Students pirate → learn the tool → get jobs → companies buy enterprise licenses. Adobe deliberately did not pursue individual users aggressively. This is the feeder funnel model.

**When piracy hurts:**
- Business/commercial use where DMCA enforcement works
- High-value single outputs (rendered images used commercially)
- When watermarking reveals pirated outputs in professional contexts

## Price Point Strategy

### Willingness-to-Pay by Region

| Region | Multiplier vs US price | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| US, Canada, Australia | 1.0× | Base price |
| Western Europe | 0.9-1.0× | Near parity |
| Eastern Europe, Russia | 0.3-0.4× | PPP-adjusted |
| Southeast Asia | 0.3-0.5× | High piracy without adjustment |
| Latin America | 0.4-0.6× | Regional pricing reduces piracy significantly |
| China | 0.2-0.3× | High piracy despite low prices; different competitive landscape |
| India | 0.2-0.3× | Extremely price-sensitive, growing market |

**Regional pricing reduces piracy more than DRM.** Spotify/Netflix data: per-capita subscription rates inversely correlate with purchasing power mismatch. Where local price = 1-2 hours local wage, piracy drops sharply.

### Subscription vs Perpetual

| Model | Piracy resistance | Customer satisfaction | Revenue predictability |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Subscription monthly | High (continuous validation) | Lower (photographer preference) | High |
| Subscription annual | Medium-high | Medium | High |
| Perpetual + update sub | Medium | High | Medium |
| Perpetual + cloud features | High | High | Medium |

**Photographer/professional tool preference:** perpetual licenses preferred. Subscription resistance is real (Topaz backlash Sep 2025, Affinity 2 launched perpetual as anti-Adobe positioning). 

**Hybrid model (recommended for ML tools):**
- Perpetual license for current model version
- Annual subscription for model updates + cloud features
- Cloud-only features (premium processing, higher resolution) require active subscription

## Anti-Piracy Investment ROI

### Cost-Benefit Framework

```text
Annual piracy cost ≈ (pirated_users × conversion_rate × ARPU)
Anti-piracy investment ROI = recovered_revenue / implementation_cost
```

**Realistic conversion rates (what fraction of pirates would pay):**
- High-quality professional tool, ~10-15% price: 10-20% of pirates convert
- B2B software (company use): 30-50% convert when enforcement is credible
- Consumer entertainment: 2-5%

**Example calculation:**
```yaml
Assumed: 1,000 pirated copies/month, $15/month ARPU, 15% conversion
Monthly recovered revenue = 1,000 × 0.15 × $15 = $2,250/month
Annual = $27,000

One-time implementation costs:
  - Encryption + license server: $20,000 dev time
  - Ongoing maintenance: $5,000/year
  
Year 1 ROI: ($27,000 - $25,000) / $25,000 = 8%
Year 2+ ROI: ($27,000 - $5,000) / $5,000 = 440%
```

**Note:** most pirates do NOT convert. Overstating conversion = justifying overinvestment in DRM.

### Tier Cost Analysis

| Protection tier | Implementation cost | Annual maintenance | % pirates deterred |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Basic (license check only) | $5K | $1K | 60-70% casual pirates |
| Standard (encrypted weights) | $15K | $3K | 80-85% |
| Advanced (key weights from server) | $30K | $8K | 90-95% |
| Maximum (all layers) | $60K | $15K | 95%+ |

Diminishing returns: going from 90% → 95% deterrence costs 2× more than 80% → 90%.

## Freemium Architecture

### What to Gate

**Free tier:** 
- Limited resolution (e.g., output max 2 MP)
- Watermark on output ("Processed with [Product]" visible overlay)
- Limited retouching types
- Cloud trial credits (20 uses)

**Paid tier:**
- Full resolution
- Invisible forensic watermark only (no visible overlay)
- All retouching types
- Offline mode (encrypted local model)
- Batch processing

**Why visible watermark on free tier works:**
- Professional cannot use watermarked output for client work
- Creates natural conversion pressure
- Free tier still provides genuine value (personal use, learning)
- Invisible forensic watermark persists → detection in both tiers

### Trial Mechanics

```text
Trial state machine:
  NEW → (usage or days) → TRIAL_ACTIVE → (limit hit) → TRIAL_EXPIRED
  
  On TRIAL_EXPIRED: 
    - Feature degrades (not hard block)
    - "Continue for $X/month" CTA visible
    - All trial outputs remain usable
    
  On PURCHASE:
    - Instant restoration (no wait)
    - Existing outputs can have forensic watermark re-embedded without overlay
```

**Optimal trial length:** 14 days or 50 uses (whichever comes first). Longer = more value extracted before decision; shorter = not enough time to evaluate professional workflow.

## Watermark as Revenue Signal

Invisible output watermarks contain `license_id`. Serve dual purpose:
1. Piracy forensics (where did leaked images come from)
2. Revenue signal: if watermark payload = trial_id, image was processed on trial → upsell opportunity

**Detection workflow:**
```text
User uploads portfolio image → check for watermark → 
  if trial_id found → "This image was processed in trial. Upgrade for client work?" 
  if license_id found → verify license still valid
  if no watermark → processed by competitor / non-watermarked source
```

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring

List full-price perpetual ($149) alongside subscription ($12/month). Most users anchor to perpetual price → subscription feels cheap. Converts higher than showing subscription alone.

### Bundling vs. Unbundling

**Retouch4me unbundled:** 13 plugins × $124-149 each. Full suite = $1,500+. Creates high sticker shock but each purchase feels "reasonable."

**Bundled alternative:** $199 all-in-one perpetual. Lower sticker shock. Better perceived value. But: users who only need 1-2 plugins see less value.

**Hybrid:** Single entry product ($49), "unlock all" upgrade path ($149). Works well for new market entrants building trust.

### Upgrade Economics

Perpetual to subscription conversion is hard. Better path: 
- Sell perpetual (what photographers want)
- Add subscription-only features they'll actually use (cloud sync, AI updates, style presets)
- Let subscription be "add-on" not "replacement"

## Enforcement Strategy

### Who to Enforce Against

| Target | Effort | Revenue potential | Recommended action |
|--------|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Individual personal use | High | Low | Don't pursue; tolerate |
| Student/learning | High | Medium (future customers) | Tolerate; seed market |
| Commercial freelancer | Medium | High | Watermark enforcement + DMCA |
| Business/enterprise | Low | Very high | Audit demand + BSA referral |
| Redistributors | Medium | Anti-piracy infrastructure | Takedowns + C&D |

**BSA (Business Software Alliance) enforcement pattern:**
- Audit demand letter sent to company → self-audit declaration required
- Settlements: $100K+ typical for commercial use
- Company must purchase licenses + destroy unlicensed copies + accept future audits
- Adobe: delegates enforcement to BSA for enterprise; ignores individuals

### Timing Kill Switch Activation

Strategic timing for graduated response activation:
- Monitor: unusual spike in download URLs for key_weights → pirate distribution detected
- Response: activate kill switch for all devices with cracked key pattern
- Recovery window: 2-4 weeks before "cracked" version stops working
- Goal: degrade experience enough to make crack less attractive, not anger legitimate users

## Gotchas

- **Overestimating conversion rate destroys ROI.** If you assume 30% of pirates convert and actual is 5%, all DRM cost calculations are wrong by 6×. Use 5-15% as baseline unless you have actual data.
- **Hard blocks create support load from legitimate users.** Corporate firewalls, network issues, VMs for testing - all trigger license checks. Graduated degradation + grace periods reduce support tickets substantially.
- **Regional pricing requires payment processor support.** Paddle and LemonSqueezy both support dynamic regional pricing; Stripe requires manual implementation.
- **Perpetual-to-subscription conversion is painful.** Topaz's move to subscription-only (Sept 2025) generated massive backlash. Introduce subscription as additive (cloud features) before removing perpetual option.
- **Freemium conversion rate 2-8%.** Plan unit economics accordingly. Free tier must be valuable enough to attract users but limited enough to create upgrade motivation.
- **Don't count piracy prevention as revenue.** "We prevented $X in piracy" is not revenue. Only count actual conversions triggered by enforcement.
