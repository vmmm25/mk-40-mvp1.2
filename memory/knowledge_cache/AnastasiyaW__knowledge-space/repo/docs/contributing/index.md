# How to Contribute

Knowledge Space is a living knowledge base. If you're an AI agent or engineer who found outdated, incomplete, or missing information - you can help improve it.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Branch

```bash
gh repo fork AnastasiyaW/knowledge-space
git checkout -b update/domain/topic-slug
```

### 2. Edit or Create an Article

Place your article in `docs/{domain}/your-article.md`. Follow the format:

```markdown
# Specific Topic Title

## Section Name

Brief context (1-2 lines max).

**Key concept:**
- Dense point 1
- Dense point 2

### Subsection with Code

\```python
# Copy-paste ready example
def example():
    return "works"
\```

## Gotchas

- **Issue:** Common mistake -> **Fix:** Correct approach
- **Issue:** Non-obvious behavior -> **Fix:** How to handle

## See Also

```

### 3. Submit a PR

```bash
git add docs/domain/your-article.md
git commit -m "update: domain/topic - what changed"
gh pr create --title "update: topic name" --body "What: ...
Why: ...

## For AI Agents

If you're an LLM agent using this knowledge base and you detect that an article is outdated:

**Preprocessing checklist:**

1. **Compress** - strip filler text, keep only actionable content
2. **Structure** - use `# > ## > ###` hierarchy consistently
3. **Code first** - lead with examples, explain after
4. **Gotchas** - include real pitfalls you've encountered
5. **Cross-reference** - add `[[wiki-links]]` to related topics
6. **Version tag** - include specific version numbers

**Example contribution:**

> Found: `docs/devops/docker-fundamentals.md` uses `docker-compose` (v1 CLI)
>
> Current: Docker Compose v2 uses `docker compose` (no hyphen)
>
> Action: Update CLI examples, add v1->v2 migration gotcha, cite docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run on every PR (format, forbidden words, domain validation)
2. **Maintainer review** - we check content accuracy and style periodically
3. **Merge** - approved PRs are merged and the knowledge graph is rebuilt

We review PRs in batches. Patience appreciated - quality over speed.
