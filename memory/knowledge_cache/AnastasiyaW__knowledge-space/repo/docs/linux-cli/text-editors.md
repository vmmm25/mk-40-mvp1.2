## Gotchas

- Vim starts in Normal mode - pressing letters executes commands, not typing text
- `:q!` discards all changes without confirmation
- nano shows keyboard shortcuts at the bottom (`^` means Ctrl)
- Vim is pre-installed on nearly all Linux systems; nano may need to be installed
- `vi` on many systems is actually `vim` (Vi IMproved)
- In vim, `u` undoes one change at a time; `U` undoes all changes on current line
