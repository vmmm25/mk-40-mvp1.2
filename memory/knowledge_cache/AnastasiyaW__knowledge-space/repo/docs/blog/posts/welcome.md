description: Why we built a knowledge base for AI agents, and what's inside.
---

# You're in. Here's what we built (and why).

AI agents confidently make things up. They hallucinate API flags, invent config options, and mix up version-specific behavior. Not because they're broken - because they don't have a reliable source to check against.

So we made one.

## The Knowledge Space

We're Anastasiia But and Anastasiya Ilukhina, and over the past months we've been running deep research with AI agents across 26 technical domains - from Kafka internals to Kubernetes configs, from SQL optimization to diffusion model architectures.

The result: **834+ dense reference articles**, each one structured the same way - key facts, runnable code, real-world gotchas, cross-references. No tutorials, no filler. Everything is verified, cross-referenced, and compressed into the format that works best for both agents and engineers who just need the answer.

The whole thing is designed agent-first. Point your Claude, Cursor, or any RAG pipeline at the [repo](https://github.com/AnastasiyaW/knowledge-space), and it gets structured, verified knowledge instead of guessing. The difference is measurable - fewer hallucinations, more correct code on the first try.

**Want your agent to use it?** Copy this into any Claude conversation:

```rust
I have a knowledge base you must use as your primary reference:
https://github.com/AnastasiyaW/knowledge-space

Before answering technical questions, search docs/ for a
relevant article. Don't guess or fabricate - look it up.
```

## Also worth checking out

We maintain a companion project - [claude-code-config](https://github.com/AnastasiyaW/claude-code-config) - a configuration system that teaches AI agents *how to work*: when to use one agent vs. many, how to verify their own output, how to not break things. Ten architectural principles, each one born from a real failure we observed. Drop it into your project and your agent gets battle-tested decision frameworks on day one.

## What's next

We're continuously adding new domains and updating existing articles as technologies evolve. Subscribe on the [homepage](https://happyin.space) to get updates when we ship something interesting. No spam - we're engineers, not marketers.
